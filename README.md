# dat.GUI.midi
A lightweight graphical user interface for changing variables in JavaScript. 

Get started with dat.GUI by reading the [tutorial](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui)
or the [API documentation](API.md).

# Specific to dat.GUI.midi vs dat.GUI
- Adds support midi controllers to number sliders/ranges.
- Detects whether midi inputs are available/present.
- If present, adds a ðŸŽµ icon button next to the slider that, when clicked, will allow you to bind the slider to their midi device by simply manipulating a control on the device.
- Multiple sliders can be bound to the same device & control.
- Slider can be unbound from midi device by clicking ðŸŽµ icon button again.

# Why does dat.GUI.midi exist?
Initially this was simply fork of dat.GUI intended to contribute this functionality. After looking at dat.GUI's backlog of pull requests it seemed that these changes may never get reviewed or approved. This library serves as means to expose that functionality until then.


## Packaged Builds
The easiest way to use dat.GUI in your code is by using the built source at `build/dat.gui.min.js`. These built JavaScript files bundle all the necessary dependencies to run dat.GUI.

In your `head` tag, include the following code:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dat.gui.min.js"></script>
```

## Installing from npm

```bash
$ npm install --save dat.gui
```

```js
// CommonJS:
const dat = require('dat.gui');

// ES6:
import * as dat from 'dat.gui';

const gui = new dat.GUI();
```

## Building your own dat.GUI

In the terminal, enter the following:

$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## npm scripts

- npm run build - Build development and production version of scripts.
- npm run dev - Build development version of script and watch for changes.


## Working with Content Security Policy
If you're using a server with a Content Security Policy in place that blocks 'unsafe-inline', you will have problems when dat.gui.js tries to inject style information. To get around this, load 'build/dat.gui.css' as an external style sheet.
